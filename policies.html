        <h1>1. Collection of Information</h1>
        <p>
          We collect personally identifiable information, like names, postal
          addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, credit card number, etc,
          when voluntarily submitted by our visitors. This information is used
          only to fulfill your specific request or process your order, unless
          you give us permission to use it in another manner, for example to add
          you to one of our contact lists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once registered with TeleWeb, you authorize us to use the information
          you provide to customize your interaction with our website.
        </p>
        <h1>2. Security</h1>
        <p>
          We use reasonable precautions to keep the personal information you
          disclose both in your browsing and your purchases and to never release
          this information to third parties. Your personally identifiable
          information is kept secure. Only authorized employees have access to
          this information. When you enter sensitive information (such as a
          credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of
          that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow
          generally accepted standards to protect the personal information
          submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
        </p>
        <p>
          No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
          storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its
          absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web
          site, you can contact us at 247@anywair.ng. If you make an order on
          this website, we will need to use, but not store, certain of the
          information provided by you in order to process your order. This will
          include details related to your payment. We do not store private
          transaction details such as credit card information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use some data collected to investigate, prevent or take action
          regarding illegal activities and violations of our Terms and
          Conditions.
        </p>
        <h1>3. Offers and Promotions</h1>
        <p>
          We will use the data you provide us to notify you of offers or
          products that may be of interest to you, but at no time will we
          provide your data to third parties for their own direct marketing
          activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name
          and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for
          your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or

        </p>
        <h1>4. Analytics/Log Files</h1>
        <p>
          As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information
          automatically and store it in log files. This information includes
          Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service
          provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
          stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not
          identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site,
          to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic
          information about our user base as a whole. We link this
          automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information,
          for example IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable
          information in the remote situations of fraud investigation.
        </p>
        <h1>5. Behavioral Targeting/Re-Targeting</h1>
        <p>
          We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising
          on our web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad
          network partners use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally
          identifiable information about your activities on this and other web
          sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.
          If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of
          serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. Please
          note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will
          continue to receive generic ads.
        </p>
        <h1>6. User Access and Choice</h1>
        <p>
          If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our
          service, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove, or deactivate
          it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing
          our Customer Support at 247@anywair.ng We will respond to your request
          to access within 14 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will retain your information for as long as your account is active
          or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your
          information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
          disputes, and enforce our agreements.
        </p>
        <h1>7. TeleWeb mobile apps</h1>
        <p>
          In order to use the service through TeleWeb mobile apps, you need to
          first open an account on our website, and the hereby Privacy Policy
          applies. In order to access TeleWeb mobile app, you need to provide
          the email registered in the account with us, and the PIN received when
          you made your first Voice Credit order; we will try to keep you logged
          in, so you can skip entering such details every time you use the app.
          If you delete the app, your online account with us will not be
          affected in any way. We do not collect personally identifiable
          information as you are using the apps. Also, we do not share
          app-tracking results with third parties, and we will only use these
          results to provide you with information you may be interested in.
          Also, to constantly improve the service and solve application crashes,
          we send some technical and non-personal data to our servers.
        </p>
        <h1>8. Tracking Technologies</h1>
        <p>
          We use cookies to remember our users’ settings (e.g. language
          preference, location etc) or for authentication. Users can control the
          use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies,
          you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or
          areas of our site may be limited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by
          TeleWeb and our advertising partners, affiliates, or analytics. These
          technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site,
          tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic
          information about our user base as a whole.
        </p>
        <h1>9. Third Parties</h1>
        <p>
          Also, in our efforts to match our products with the people interested
          in them, we use advertising services belonging to third party vendors,
          such as Google. Your visit on our website is likely to be a result of
          this third party service provided to us (AdWords, DoubleClick, etc),
          as well as a source to be exposed to future ads based on your past
          visits and interests. To opt out the use of cookies you should visit
          the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our presence across the Internet is the outcome of this matching of
          users’ preference and products available. In order to reach the right
          audience, the external companies we collaborate with may use certain
          information to establish consumers’ habits: visits to a website, goods
          and services to determine or predict our visitors’ characteristics,
          behavior, or preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anonymous data collected from visits to our websites is matched by
          external companies to larger pools of data (from more websites) to
          deliver ads to people with similar browsing pattern to our visitors.
          Thus, consumers receive more relevant ads and advertisers benefit from
          more effective advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such data collected DOES NOT INCLUDE our visitor’s name, address,
          email address, telephone number. More information on how Google stores
          such data in the user’s browser (using a “cookie”) can be found here.
        </p>

          Like button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page
          you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the
          Feature to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted
          by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions
